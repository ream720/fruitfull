MR AG:
Dude this is sick! Yea I have extra pics too. In each strain channel I have a post with pics of press, plants and hash. Don’t know if you want to grab those or want me to compile them.
I can write some more info about each strain!
ME: I did the 4 strains listed in the section: WW, RG5S1, OAB, RJ

            Fruitfull Seeds was started by <span class="text-ff-text-primary font-bold">Mr. Autogrow</span>, a single source hashmaker from Kentucky.
            Most known for his selection of <span class="text-ff-grape-neon">Rainbow Guava #5</span>, Mr. Autogrow began breeding to find and create unique and diverse fruit terps with an emphasis on solventless production.
          </p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed mt-6">
            Using only his own selections, Mr. Autogrow launched Fruitfull Seeds in <span class="text-ff-text-primary font-bold">February 2025</span> with the first release of his <span class="text-ff-grape-vivid font-medium">Grape Rainbow Pie Line</span>.
          </p>

  Blueberry/wildberry terps ranging from blueberry muffins/pie crust to blue ICEE slushy terps & more. Low solventless yield with average to high biomass yield.

growNotes: >
  Found one keeper in a few seeds. She was a big plant with more than average biomass. Definitely want to hunt large population of these to find a dumper with blue slushy terps.

  Blueberry ICEE and Wildberry Poptart terps. She washed right over 3% in two washes and she tastes unreal.

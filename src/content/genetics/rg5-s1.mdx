  Bugelz corn chip funk. Raunchy belts with tropical funk.

overview: >
  Rainbow Guava #5 S1. Terps ranging from tropical fruit (guavas, pineapples) to heavy corn chip (belts) raunch. This plant packs heavy solventless returns and heavy biomass yields.

growNotes: >
  Only popped two and they were both so similar to Rainbow Guava #5. Heavy biomass yields with consistent expressions. A winner and a fun freebie!

hashmakerNotes: >
  The S1 mixed wash produced a very wet resin. The terps were bugelz corn chip funk with tropical fruit mixed in. Reminded me of a refined Rainbow Guava #5.

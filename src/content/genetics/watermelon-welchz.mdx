growNotes: >
  Found a keeper in just a few seeds. She produced average biomass yield but impressed all around with her nostalgic watermelon profile.

hashmakerNotes: >
  Wet, 6 ⭐️ resin with watermelon bubbalicious terps. Definitely some pink berry flavor from the Grape Rainbow Pie, but it was like Watermelon Sugaree on steroids. She washed around 5% in two washes.

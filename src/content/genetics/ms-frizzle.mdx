  Fermented tropical fruit and purple Kool Aid. Grape peach Snapple, musky berries and lime guava cheese.

overview: >
  Found two different keepers in the seeds popped. One pheno was more of a Rambutan leaner
  with a heavy guava fermented mango funk followed by a purple Flinstones vitamins exhale.
  The other pheno was like a peach purple Kool-Aid, very Grape Rainbow Pie dominant.
  Unstable and incredibly wet full melt and rosin all around. 6-star quality melt.

growNotes: >
  Average to high biomass and hash yields on these plants. Average to heavy
  biomass yield.

hashmakerNotes: >
  Unstable and incredibly wet full melt and rosin all around. Top quality melt that you
  have to freeze to collect. Both plants did over 5%, which is very impressive considering
  the nature of the resin heads. Average to high solventless yield.

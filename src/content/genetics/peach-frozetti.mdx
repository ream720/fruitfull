overview: >
  Like a few other Grape Rainbow Pie hybrids, kept two pretty different selections from the hunt.
  One pheno was like a purple candied peach. Really reminded me of a blended purple and orange
  Crème Saver. That one was a HUGE plant and did right under 5% on two washes. The other pheno
  was like the Peach Ringz selection used in the cross, but on steroids. Bigger plant, did 5.5%
  in two washes. Both phenos were 6-star quality resin and super wet. All around this is one of
  the best Grape Rainbow Pie hybrids.

growNotes: >
  Medium to high hash yields with average to heavy biomass. One pheno was a HUGE plant. Also
  had a cherry berry bubblegum pheno that was epic resin but washed low and wasn't the biggest
  plant. Lots of variations to be found.

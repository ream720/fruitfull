overview: >
  Missing Bow is a candy-forward, dessert-leaning cultivar with heavy Rainbow Belts
  influence and a creamy backend from Grape Rainbow Pie. This one excels in texture
  and mouthfeel post-press, producing rosin with noticeable creaminess and dense vapor.

growNotes: >
  Predictable medium stretch with uniform canopy response. Finishes cleanly at ~65 days
  with strong color development under cooler nights.

hashmakerNotes: >
  Missing Bow favors slightly larger microns than Berry Mist, with standout results
  in the 90–120µ range. Terps skew toward creamy candy rather than sharp citrus.

  mixed berry Skittles, Sweet Tarts candy chalk, berry Z.

overview: >
  Missing Bow is a candy-forward, dessert-leaning cultivar with heavy Rainbow Belts
  influence and a creamy backend from Grape Rainbow Pie. Found 1 keeper in 5 seeds.
  Some phenos had GRP consistency and some had Belts consistency. All had Z and GRP terps.
  6-star resin across the board with some phenos harder to work with. Improved Belts structure
  with an amazing candy Z & candy berry, grape Z profile.

growNotes: >
  Predictable medium stretch with uniform canopy response. Finishes cleanly at ~65 days
  with strong color development under cooler nights. Two phenos did 5% and the rest did
  4-4.5%. Selection was based on the best mix of both parents with the biggest structure.

hashmakerNotes: >
  Missing Bow favors slightly larger microns than Berry Mist, with standout results
  in the 90–120µ range. Terps skew toward creamy candy rather than sharp citrus.
  Very wet, unstable, 6-star resin. Medium to high solventless yield with average
  biomass yield.

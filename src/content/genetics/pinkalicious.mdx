overview: >
  Found two completely different keepers in the seeds popped. One pheno was straight creamy Z;
  like a sister to Watermelon Z. Amazing terps and consistency that washed over 6%. The other
  pheno was like a pink cherry kids drink. Fizzy hard candy mystery berry terps. All 4 phenos
  washed heavy. Low to average biomass on these plants but the hash yields make up for it.

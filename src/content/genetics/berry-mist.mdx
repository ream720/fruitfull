overview: >
  Second Berry Mist hunt. On the first hunt, lost the pheno liked the best. So hunted a few
  more and found two great plants and one obvious standout. Amazing melt and wet consistency
  just like Rambutan #6. Lots of purple lime or red/orange Cream Saver fizzy drink. Absolutely
  gigantic plants. All plants tripled in size. 3 phenos did 5% and 2 did 6%. Crazy plants in
  these seeds.

hashmakerNotes: >
  Amazing melt and wet consistency just like Rambutan #6. Excellent washer performance with
  greasy, terp-saturated heads. 3 phenos did 5% and 2 did 6%. Best results across 73µ, 90µ,
  and 120µ bags with medium-high yields dependent on washer skill.

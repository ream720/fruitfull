  Raspberry and grape jolly ranchers. Raunchy burgers, bright pomegranate juice. Sweet fruits

overview: >
  Artificial grape and berry candy terps ranging from red and purple jolly ranchers to sweet crème savers & GMO funk & more. High solventless yield with high biomass yield.

growNotes: >
  Found multiple keepers in just a few seeds. The artificial grape and berry is prominent in this seed stock. High washers with heavy biomass yields.

hashmakerNotes: >
  First keeper was a sweet crème saver with a GMO acetone raunch. Very potent and very loud. Second keeper was less GMO dominant and had a heavy artificial berry hard candy flavor that reminded me of red and purple jolly ranchers. All these plants did over 6% in two washes in the 73-159 micron range.

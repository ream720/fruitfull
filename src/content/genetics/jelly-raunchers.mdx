expressions: >
  Sweet hard candy & sour berry pastries. Tart jelly, raunchy garlic & grape diesel notes.

overview: >
  From 6 seeds down to 2 winners, then down to 1. Serious wash numbers as every pheno
  did over 5% and some close to 7%. Think purple berry chem/deathstar. Nostalgic sour
  dubb and even some diesel terps with heavy jelly pastry mixed berry flavor. Lots of
  heavy effects in these. Another cultivar with very big plants.

growNotes: >
  Phenos are split between being tall with a huge stretch or being squatty with a decent stretch. Stringy, large heads with the nostalgic funky sour flavor. Berries and pastry candy on the mix as well.

hashmakerNotes: >
  Exceptional wash performance across the board. Every pheno did over 5% and some close
  to 7%. Heavy jelly pastry mixed berry flavor with purple berry chem/deathstar notes.
